def entries_histogram(turnstile_weather):
    '''
    Before we perform any analysis, it might be useful to take a
    look at the data we're hoping to analyze. More specifically, let's 
    examine the hourly entries in our NYC subway data and determine what
    distribution the data follows. This data is stored in a dataframe
    called turnstile_weather under the ['ENTRIESn_hourly'] column.
    
    Let's plot two histograms on the same axes to show hourly
    entries when raining vs. when not raining. Here's an example on how
    to plot histograms with pandas and matplotlib:
    turnstile_weather['column_to_graph'].hist()
    
    Your histogram may look similar to bar graph in the instructor notes below.
    
    You can read a bit about using matplotlib and pandas to plot histograms here:
    http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html#histograms
    
    You can see the information contained within the turnstile weather data here:
    https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/courses/ud359/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv

    plt.figure()
    turnstile_weather[turnstile_weather['rain']==0]['ENTRIESn_hourly'].hist(bins=200, label="No Rain").set_xlim([0, 6000]) # your code here to plot a historgram for hourly entries when it is raining
    turnstile_weather[turnstile_weather['rain']==1]['ENTRIESn_hourly'].hist(bins=200, label="Rain").set_xlim([0, 6000]) # your code here to plot a historgram for hourly entries when it is not raining

def mann_whitney_plus_means(turnstile_weather):
    '''
    This function will consume the turnstile_weather dataframe containing
    our final turnstile weather data. 
    
    You will want to take the means and run the Mann Whitney U-test on the 
    ENTRIESn_hourly column in the turnstile_weather dataframe.
    
    This function should return:
        1) the mean of entries with rain
        2) the mean of entries without rain
        3) the Mann-Whitney U-statistic and p-value comparing the number of entries
           with rain and the number of entries without rain
    
    You should feel free to use scipy's Mann-Whitney implementation, and you 
    might also find it useful to use numpy's mean function.
    
    Here are the functions' documentation:
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu.html
    http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.mean.html

# Is the distribution of the number of entries statistically different between

    You can download the complete turnstile weather dataframe here:
    https://www.dropbox.com/s/meyki2wl9xfa7yk/turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv    
    
    Your prediction should have a R^2 value of 0.40 or better.
    You need to experiment using various input features contained in the dataframe. 
    We recommend that you don't use the EXITSn_hourly feature as an input to the 
    linear model because we cannot use it as a predictor: we cannot use exits 
    counts as a way to predict entry counts. 
    
    Note: Due to the memory and CPU limitation of our Amazon EC2 instance, we will
    give you a random subet (~15%) of the data contained in

"""
In this optional exercise, you should complete the function called 
predictions(turnstile_weather). This function takes in our pandas 
turnstile weather dataframe, and returns a set of predicted ridership values,
based on the other information in the dataframe.  

In exercise 3.5 we used Gradient Descent in order to compute the coefficients
theta used for the ridership prediction. Here you should attempt to implement 
another way of computing the coeffcients theta. You may also try using a reference implementation such as: 
http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html

One of the advantages of the statsmodels implementation is that it gives you
easy access to the values of the coefficients theta. This can help you infer relationships 
between variables in the dataset.

You may also experiment with polynomial terms as part of the input variables.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression

This is your playground. Go wild!

How does your choice of linear regression compare to linear regression
with gradient descent computed in Exercise 3.5?

You can look at the information contained in the turnstile_weather dataframe below:

Note: due to the memory and CPU limitation of our amazon EC2 instance, we will
give you a random subset (~10%) of the data contained in turnstile_data_master_with_weather.csv

If you receive a "server has encountered an error" message, that means you are hitting 
the 30 second limit that's placed on running your program. See if you can optimize your code so it
runs faster.
